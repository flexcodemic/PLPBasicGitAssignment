# PLPBasicGitAssignment

## Steps By Step Process

My first step is to create a folder/directory in my local machine(PC) and then **"cd"** into the directory
Second step is to initialize these directory with the **"git init"** command and then create a *README.md*.
Next step, I created a *"hello.txt"* using **cat > hello.txt** and then typed in the text *"Hello, Git!"* from my git bash terminal.
Third step is to "git add ." and then *"commit"* using the **commit -m "Add hello.txt with a greeting"**.
Fourth step is to ensure my authentication is done by using the following command:

`git config --global user.name "Anthony Aruma"
git config --global user.email "anthonyaruma091@gmail.com"`

I already have a GitHub Account. I then created a new **"Repo"** called *"PLPBasicGitAssignment"*.

Final step, I git remote add origin with my repo url from my GitHub Account using the command: **git remote add origin my-url.git**. Then git push from my local repo to my remote repo, using **"git push -u origin main"**.
